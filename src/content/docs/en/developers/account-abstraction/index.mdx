**Account Abstraction**

An account abstraction proposal which completely avoids the need for consensus-layer protocol changes. 

Instead of adding new protocol features and changing the bottom-layer transaction type, this proposal introduces a higher-layer pseudo-transaction object called a UserOperation. 

Users send UserOperation objects into a new separate mempool. 

Bundlers package up a set of these objects into a single transaction by making a call to a special contract, and that transaction then gets included in a block.

## What is ERC4337

ERC-4337 (opens in a new tab) (Account Abstraction via Entry Point Contract specification) is a specification that aims to use an entry point contract to achieve account abstraction without changing the consensus layer protocol of Ethereum.

Instead of modifying the logic of the consensus layer itself, ERC-4337 replicates the functionality of the transaction mempool in a higher-level system. 

Users send UserOperation objects that package up the user’s intent along with signatures and other data for verification. 

Either miners or bundlers using services such as Flashbots can package up a set of UserOperation objects into a single “bundle transaction”, which then gets included into an Ethereum block.
